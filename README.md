An OpenRefine reconciliation service for [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/).

The service queries the [GeoNames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
and provides normalized scores across queries for reconciling in Refine.

Instructions for use coming soon.

Michael Stephens wrote a [demo reconcilliation service](https://github.com/mikejs/reconcile-demo) and Ted Lawless wrote a [FAST reconciliation service](https://github.com/lawlesst/fast-reconcile) that this code basic repeats but for a different API. Please pay any thanks for this work to Ted Lawless first, and any complaints to Christina.
