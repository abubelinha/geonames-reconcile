##About

An OpenRefine reconciliation service for [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/).

The service queries the [GeoNames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
and provides normalized scores across queries for reconciling in Refine.

#Provenance

Michael Stephens wrote a [demo reconcilliation service](https://github.com/mikejs/reconcile-demo) and Ted Lawless wrote a [FAST reconciliation service](https://github.com/lawlesst/fast-reconcile) that this code basically repeats but for a different API.

Please give any thanks for this work to Ted Lawless, and any complaints to Christina.
